### Google Professional Cloud Security Engineer (PCSE) | ISC2 member and Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) | DevOps | Sys admin (Linux and Windows) | Self-taught Ethical Hacker | Technical Writer

I'm a person who keeps moral and ethical values above everything else. I strongly believe in the power of knowledge and I'm chasing the same in my favorite field - IT. After all, I love playing in the IT operations theatre :)

I got my Bachelor of Technology degree in the IT department from SRM Valliammai Engineering College, Chennai. I started my career in IT as a DevOps engineer at Mafiree. Right now, I'm working on the following areas at Mafiree:-

- Linux and Windows troubleshooting
- Linux and Windows desktop administration. 
- Linux server administration. 
- Web server monitoring. 
- Implementing and maintaining Access Control Systems
- IT support (helpdesk)

Although real-life experience and practical skills are the heart of IT, I do certifications in the meantime to keep myself updated and prove my knowledge in a specific domain. I'm certified in cyber security by ISC2 (CC) and Professional Cloud Security Engineer (PCSE). I'm now actively learning core DevOps stuff like virtualization, CI/CD pipelines, automation, IaC, etc.
